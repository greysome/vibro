An instrument controlled by computer keyboard and mouse. Demo [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdXwC5mfPfI).

## Controls

- `Z S X D C` ... `, L . ; /` are the notes
- `- = BACKSPACE` to switch between triangle, sawtooth and pulse waves
- `1 ... 0` for global volume control
- Move mouse left/right for local volume control
- Spam `SPACE` for vibrato. How long you press it controls depth, how fast you press it controls speed.
- Left/right click to temporarily adjust octave
- `UP/DOWN` to permanently adjust octave
- Scroll to pitch bend
- Move mouse up/down to gliss
- `ALT` for drop effect
- `CTRL` to sustain
- `CAPS LOCK` to toggle gliss lock (easier to change volume without changing pitch)
- `SHIFT` to enable constant volume (meaning each new note will start at the same global volume)
- `TAB` to toggle fullscreen
- `` ` `` to record

## Notes

- This is still in an early development stage, in particular some keyboard parameters like volume envelopes have to be modified directly in source code. I haven't thought of a user-friendly interface for modifying parameters.
